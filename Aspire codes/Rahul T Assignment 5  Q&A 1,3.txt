1. Write an algorithm to count the number words in a input text file.

ALGORITHM
1.choose a file and access it with FileInputSteam 
2.Get the Inputs by using InputStreamReader
3.Assert for True( The should contain string )
  we can read and manipulate the string in the file with the help of BufferedReader
  Assert for False( The file is empty )
4.Store the splited words in a string array.
5.Display the number of words in the array as the count.

JAVA PROGRAM
import java.io.*;
public class UntitledDoc {
    public static void main(String args[])throws IOException{
        File file = new File("Doc.txt");
        FileInputStream filestream = new FileInputStream(file);
        InputStreamReader in = new InputStreamReader(filestream);
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(in);

        String line;
	int countWord = 0;
        while((line = br.readLine())!=null) {
            if(!line.equals(""));
            String[] wordList = line.split("\\s+");
	    countWord += wordList.length;
        }
	System.out.println("The number of words in the file is :"+countWord);
    }
}


Test case
Input File data
This is a sample file.
Output - 5

4. Draw a flowchart for the following process:
	-- sorting a set of element using shell sort.

Algorithm
1.Intialize an array and get the values
2.compare first two elements and place the biggest value in second element with a swaping technique
3.Do this for the rest of array and start the index value until it is filled in its correct position
4.Do this for the consiquitive elements.
